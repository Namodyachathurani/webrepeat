This analysis encompasses the system's architecture, security implementations, performance considerations, and recommendations for future enhancements. The primary objective of this report is to document the current system state and provide a roadmap for future development efforts.

## 1. Introduction

The t-shirt printing e-commerce system represents a sophisticated web application designed to facilitate online product browsing, customer communication, and administrative management. The system employs a containerized architecture, ensuring consistency across development and production environments while maintaining scalability and security. This implementation utilizes modern web technologies and follows industry best practices for web application development.

The system's architecture is divided into two primary components: a customer-facing frontend for product browsing and interaction, and an administrative backend for content and user management. This separation of concerns allows for independent scaling and maintenance of each component while maintaining system cohesion.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Technical Stack

The system's foundation rests on a carefully selected technology stack that prioritizes reliability and maintainability. At its core, the application utilizes PHP 8.1, leveraging its improved type system and performance enhancements. The database layer employs MariaDB 10.6, chosen for its compatibility with MySQL while offering improved performance characteristics and additional features.

The development and deployment environment is containerized using Docker, which provides several advantages:
1. Consistent environment configuration across development and production
2. Isolated services with defined dependencies
3. Simplified deployment and scaling capabilities
4. Efficient resource utilization through containerization

### 2.2 Database Design

The database architecture implements a normalized schema designed to maintain data integrity while supporting efficient querying. The schema consists of four primary tables:

The Users table manages authentication and authorization data, implementing a role-based access control system. It includes fields for credential management and user identification:

```sql
users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    role ENUM('admin', 'user') DEFAULT 'user',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

Product categorization is handled through the Categories table, which maintains a hierarchical structure for product organization:

```sql
categories (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
)
```

The Products table serves as the central repository for product information, implementing foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity:

```sql
products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    image_url VARCHAR(255),
    category INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (category) REFERENCES categories(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
)
```

Customer communications are managed through the Contact Messages table, which implements a status tracking system:

```sql
contact_messages (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    subject VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    status ENUM('new', 'read', 'replied') DEFAULT 'new'
)
```

## 3. Security Implementation

### 3.1 Authentication and Authorization

The system implements a comprehensive security framework centered around session-based authentication and role-based access control. Password security is maintained through the use of PHP's password_hash() function implementing the BCrypt algorithm. However, the current session management system requires enhancement to meet modern security standards.

Recommended session security configurations have been identified to improve the system's security posture:

```php
ini_set('session.gc_maxlifetime', 3600);    // 1 hour timeout
ini_set('session.cookie_secure', 1);         // Secure cookies
ini_set('session.cookie_httponly', 1);       // HTTP-only cookies
ini_set('session.use_strict_mode', 1);       // Strict mode
ini_set('session.cookie_samesite', 'Lax');   // SameSite cookie attribute
```

### 3.2 Data Protection

Data protection measures include prepared statements for all database operations, comprehensive input validation, and XSS prevention through output encoding. The system currently lacks CSRF protection and rate limiting, which have been identified as critical security enhancements.

The following security headers are recommended for implementation:

```apache
Header set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
Header set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
Header set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
Header set Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'"
```

## 4. Frontend Architecture

The frontend implementation adopts a mobile-first approach, utilizing modern CSS features including Flexbox and Grid layouts. The responsive design ensures optimal user experience across various device sizes and resolutions. The interface implements a component-based architecture, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

Key frontend features include:
- Responsive grid system for product displays
- Dynamic category filtering
- Modal-based product detail views
- Form validation with immediate user feedback
- Optimized image loading and display

## 5. Administrative Interface

The administrative interface provides comprehensive system management capabilities through a secure, role-based dashboard. This interface implements CRUD operations for all system entities, including products, categories, user accounts, and customer messages.

The dashboard presents real-time statistics and recent activity monitoring, enabling efficient system management. The interface is structured around five primary modules:

1. Dashboard Overview: Presents system statistics and recent activity
2. Product Management: Handles product CRUD operations and image management
3. Category Management: Maintains product categorization
4. Message Management: Processes customer communications
5. User Management: Administers system access control

## 6. Development Environment

The development environment is containerized using Docker Compose, implementing three primary services:

1. PHP Application Container:
   - Apache web server with mod_rewrite enabled
   - PHP 8.1 with necessary extensions
   - Configured file permissions and upload handling

2. MariaDB Container:
   - UTF-8 character set configuration
   - Persistent data storage
   - Automated initialization scripts

3. phpMyAdmin Container:
   - Database administration interface
   - Configured upload limits
   - Secure root access

## 7. Performance Considerations

Current performance optimization opportunities include:

### 7.1 Caching Implementation

A file-based caching system is recommended for implementation:

```php
class Cache {
    private $cache_path = '/path/to/cache';
    private $cache_time = 3600;

    public function get($key) {
        $file = $this->cache_path . '/' . md5($key);
        if (file_exists($file) && (time() - filemtime($file)) < $this->cache_time) {
            return unserialize(file_get_contents($file));
        }
        return false;
    }

    public function set($key, $data) {
        $file = $this->cache_path . '/' . md5($key);
        return file_put_contents($file, serialize($data));
    }
}
```

### 7.2 Image Optimization

Image processing optimization is recommended through the implementation of:

```php
function process_upload_image($file, $destination) {
    $image_info = getimagesize($file['tmp_name']);
    $max_width = 1200;
    $max_height = 1200;

    if ($image_info[0] > $max_width || $image_info[1] > $max_height) {
        $image = imagecreatefromstring(file_get_contents($file['tmp_name']));
        $width = $image_info[0];
        $height = $image_info[1];

        // Calculate new dimensions
        if ($width > $height) {
            $new_width = $max_width;
            $new_height = floor($height * ($max_width / $width));
        } else {
            $new_height = $max_height;
            $new_width = floor($width * ($max_height / $height));
        }

        $new_image = imagecreatetruecolor($new_width, $new_height);
        imagecopyresampled($new_image, $image, 0, 0, 0, 0, $new_width, $new_height, $width, $height);
        imagejpeg($new_image, $destination, 85);
    }
}
```
